Shankar Ambady of Session M will give a tutorial on the Python NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit). 
Shankar had previously presented a comprehensive overview of the NLTK  last December at the Python meetup.  
The Python NLTK is a very powerful collection of libraries that can be applied to a variety of NLP applications
